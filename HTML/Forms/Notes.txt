in form tag 
action="/action_page.php" -  the form data is sent to a file called "action_page.php"
If the action attribute is omitted, the action is set to the current page.

The target attribute specifies where to display the response that is received after submitting the form.
Value	Description
_blank	The response is displayed in a new window or tab
_self	The response is displayed in the current window
_parent	The response is displayed in the parent frame -----> Used when the page is inside a frame.
_top	The response is displayed in the full body of the window
framename	The response is displayed in a named iframe



The method attribute specifies the HTTP method to be used when submitting the form data.
The default HTTP method when submitting form data is GET. 

The form-data can be sent as URL variables (with method="get") or as HTTP post transaction (with method="post").


Notes on GET:

Appends the form data to the URL, in name/value pairs
NEVER use GET to send sensitive data! (the submitted form data is visible in the URL!)
The length of a URL is limited (2048 characters)
Useful for form submissions where a user wants to bookmark the result
GET is good for non-secure data, like query strings in Google


Notes on POST:

Appends the form data inside the body of the HTTP request (the submitted form data is not shown in the URL)
POST has no size limitations, and can be used to send large amounts of data.
Form submissions with POST cannot be bookmarked

Tip: Always use POST if the form data contains sensitive or personal information!


Autocomplete Attribute
automatically complete values based on values that the user has entered before.

The novalidate attribute is a boolean attribute.
