        <p class="container">The image shows a cluster of Hesperantha coccinea flowers, also known as the crimson flag
            lily or river lily.
            These flowers are characterized by their vibrant pink to scarlet color, star-like shape, and delicate
            petals.
            They typically bloom in late summer and autumn, adding a splash of color to gardens when many other flowers
            are
            fading. Hesperantha coccinea is native to Southern Africa and Zimbabwe and is often found in wet areas or
            near
            streams, which is why it's also referred to as the river lily. It thrives in moist soils and can tolerate
            poorly
            drained conditions. This plant is valued for its late-season blooms and is often used in borders, water
            gardens,
            and as cut flowers due to their long-lasting nature. </p>
