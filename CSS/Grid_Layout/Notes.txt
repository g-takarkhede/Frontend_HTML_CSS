A grid will typically have columns, rows, and then gaps between each row and column. 
The gaps are commonly referred to as gutters.

The fr unit distributes available space, not all space. 

gaps can be any length unit or percentage, but not an fr unit.

justify-items --> within cell
justify-content --> within container

place-content = align-content + justify-content

Explicit grid is created using grid-template-columns or grid-template-rows.

Implicit grid extends the defined explicit grid when content is placed outside of that grid, 
such as into the rows by drawing additional grid lines.
grid-auto-rows or grid-auto-columns


The rules for grid-template-areas are as follows:

You need to have every cell of the grid filled.
To span across two cells, repeat the name.
To leave a cell empty, use a . (period).
Areas must be rectangular â€” for example, you can't have an L-shaped area.
Areas can't be repeated in different locations.
