Responsive web design, or RWD, is a design approach that addresses the range of devices and device sizes, 
enabling automatic adaption to the screen, whether the content is viewed on a tablet, phone, television, or watch.


The screen keyword tells the browser that this media query applies only when viewing the page on a screen (like a desktop, tablet, or smartphone).
all → Default; applies to all devices.
print → For printed documents.
speech → For screen readers.

The points at which a media query is introduced, and the layout changed, are known as breakpoints.

Designing for mobile first is known as mobile first design.
