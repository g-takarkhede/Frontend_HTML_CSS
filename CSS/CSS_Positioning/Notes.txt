Different Types of Positioning in CSS

static (default) - No effect of top, left, right, or bottom.
relative - top, left, right, and bottom work and shift the element without affecting surrounding elements.
absolute - The element is removed from the normal flow and positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (not static).
fixed - The element is removed from the normal flow and positioned relative to the viewport(browser).
sticky - Acts like relative until a certain scroll position is reached, then it behaves like fixed.


No Margin Collapsing with Positioned Elements except relative and static

absolute - it is placed relative to the nearest ancestor that has a position other than static (i.e., relative, absolute, fixed, or sticky).

z-index 
 Only works on elements with position: relative/absolute/fixed/sticky
